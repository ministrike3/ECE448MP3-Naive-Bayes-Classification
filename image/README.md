## Steps Remaining For Part 1.2 for additional points

build Naive Bayes classifiers for feature sets of n*m disjoint/overlapping pixel patches and report the following:

Test set accuracies for disjoint patches of size 2*2, 2*4, 4*2, 4*4.

Test set accuracies for overlapping patches of size 2*2, 2*4, 4*2, 4*4, 2*3, 3*2, 3*3.

Discussion of the trends you have observed for the different feature sets (including single pixels), in particular, why certain features work better than others for this task.

Brief discussion of running time for training and testing for the different feature sets (which ones are faster and why, and how does the running time scale with feature set size).
